i love studying programming stuff, testing new things and creating projects. I'm currently focused on iOS development.






### Hi, I'm Gabrielly. 👋 

- I'm learning mobile development, focusing on 🍎 iOS (mainly Swift).

    ```swift
  let gabs: [String: Any] = [ "code": ["Swift", "UIKit", "SwiftUI"],
                             "currentFocus": "learning mobile with Swift"]
  ```
