### Hi, I'm Gabrielly. 👋🏽

- Student of Systems Analysis and Development.
- I'm learning mobile development, focusing on 🍎 iOS (mainly Swift).

  ```swift
  let gabs: [String: Any] = ["pronouns": "she-her",
                             "code": ["Swift", "UIKit", "SwiftUI"],
                             "currentFocus": "learning mobile with Swift"]
  ```
